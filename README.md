üìÅ Admin-User Management Service ‚Äî NestJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, TypeORM
1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview
This project is a backend service designed to manage user administration, secure authentication, document ingestion, and background scheduling tasks.
It is built using NestJS, following a modular, scalable architecture aimed at showcasing:

Clean separation of concerns through controllers, services, and DTOs.
Secure handling of user data and authentication with industry-standard practices.
Robust database management with Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL.
Background job scheduling capabilities using @nestjs/schedule.
Strong validation layers and error-handling mechanisms.
Comprehensive testing and automatic API documentation for ease of use and verification.
The project reflects real-world design decisions focusing on maintainability, reliability, and security ‚Äî suitable for large-scale backend systems.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Tech Stack
This project uses a carefully chosen technology stack designed for reliability, scalability, and maintainability:

Technology	Purpose
NestJS	Main backend framework supporting modular design and dependency injection.
Prisma ORM	For database schema management, migrations, and type-safe database queries.
PostgreSQL	Primary database to store user and document data with reliability and scalability.
TypeORM	Used for certain ORM operations and legacy integrations alongside Prisma.
Jest	For writing unit tests and ensuring code correctness.
Supertest	For writing end-to-end tests with HTTP assertions.
Swagger (OpenAPI)	Provides live API documentation for quick testing and exploration.
argon2	Used for secure and modern password hashing.
@nestjs/schedule	Enables cron-based scheduling and background task execution.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Database Schema Design
The project uses PostgreSQL as its primary relational database, managed via Prisma ORM.

The User model contains fields such as id, username, email, password, timestamps, and relations to documents.
The Document model includes metadata like file name, file path, creator reference, and timestamps.
Key highlights in database design:

Auto-incremented primary keys for both user and document records.
Unique constraints on usernames and email addresses for user integrity.
Relation fields that link documents to the users who uploaded them.
Automatic timestamp handling for creation and modification tracking.
Use of secure password hashing before storing sensitive data.
Consistent use of migrations for schema evolution and rollback.
All database relations and constraints are designed to ensure data integrity and easy maintenance.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Project Structure & Module Explanation
The project structure is designed to ensure readability, separation of concerns, and scalability. Each module serves a well-defined purpose:

Key Modules:
Auth Module:

Handles user login, authentication, and JWT token generation.
Uses modern authentication strategies with secure hashing for passwords.
Ensures proper validation and error handling for login attempts.
Users Module:

Manages user creation, listing, and deletion functionalities.
Strong validation is enforced via DTOs.
Implements role-based access control for admin-level operations.
Documents Module:

Manages file uploads and ingestion processes.
Contains ingestion logic that reads uploaded Excel files and validates rows.
Includes error handling that halts ingestion if any invalid data is detected.
Supports file metadata storage in the database.
Scheduler Module:

Manages background tasks using cron scheduling.
Can trigger automatic ingestion processes or routine maintenance operations.
Supports both automatic scheduling and manual triggers.
Common Module:

Houses reusable guards, interceptors, and global exception filters.
Ensures consistent responses and error messaging across all modules.
Prisma Service:

Provides a centralized database connection.
Manages Prisma client lifecycle and allows injection into services.
Architectural Principles:
Each module is independently testable and follows SOLID principles.
Controllers handle request routing and delegate business logic to services.
DTOs are used for strong validation and to prevent malformed data from reaching services.
Error handling is managed globally, with graceful error responses returned to the API consumer.
Sensitive operations such as password storage use modern, secure hashing mechanisms.

5Ô∏è‚É£ API Documentation (Swagger)
This project includes fully automated API documentation using Swagger, making it easy for developers or testers to understand the endpoints, payload structures, and expected responses.
Clink on this link for the API documentation:- http://localhost:3000/api-docs


Key Documentation Features:
Each API endpoint is annotated with detailed descriptions and examples.
Request body schemas are defined using DTOs, with visible constraints and validations.
The API documentation also reflects authentication requirements and role-based access.
Includes examples of successful and failed responses, with status codes and descriptive messages.
The documentation interface allows live testing of each endpoint without additional setup.

Key API Endpoints (Descriptive):
HTTP Method	Endpoint	Functionality
POST	/auth/login	Authenticates a user and returns a JWT token.
POST	/users	Allows creation of a new user (admin-restricted).
GET	/users	Lists all users in the system (authenticated route).
POST	/documents/ingest	Handles document ingestion from uploaded files.
GET	/scheduler/trigger	Manually triggers scheduled background jobs (authenticated route).
Authentication, request/response examples, and validation errors are thoroughly described in the Swagger UI, providing clarity and confidence to developers interacting with the APIs.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Testing Strategy
Testing is a core part of this project, ensuring that each unit and flow works as expected.

Testing Approach:
Unit Testing:

Written for controllers and services to verify business logic in isolation.
Includes success and failure scenarios, with thorough assertion checks.
Integration Testing:

Focuses on complete request-to-response verification for critical functionalities like user creation, authentication, and document ingestion.
Helps catch issues that unit tests may not detect by testing real database interaction.
E2E Testing:

End-to-end testing simulates complete workflows.
Ensures that all components (auth, users, ingestion) integrate and function together as expected.
Testing Tools Used:
Jest:
Main testing framework used for unit and integration testing.
Supertest:
For writing HTTP assertions and testing REST endpoints.
Coverage:
All critical service methods are covered with success and error case tests.
Authentication flows are tested for invalid and valid scenarios.
Document ingestion is tested to ensure row-level validation and error halting logic works correctly.
Test Execution:
Tests are grouped by module (auth, users, documents).
Coverage reports are generated to track test completeness and identify gaps.
Watch mode enables quick feedback during development.
E2E tests simulate real API interactions in isolated environments.
